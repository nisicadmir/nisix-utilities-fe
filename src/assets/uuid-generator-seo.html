    <h1>UUID Generator Tool</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to our UUID Generator, a reliable tool for creating universally unique identifiers instantly. UUIDs (Universally
      Unique Identifiers) are 128-bit numbers used to uniquely identify information in computer systems without central
      coordination, making them essential for distributed applications, databases, and web services.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Use Our UUID Generator?</h2>
    <p>
      Our UUID Generator provides standardized, collision-resistant unique identifiers following RFC 4122 specifications. These
      identifiers are critical for many technical applications where uniqueness across space and time is essential. Our tool
      generates Version 4 UUIDs using cryptographically strong random numbers to ensure the highest level of uniqueness and
      security for your applications.
    </p>

    <h3>Features of the UUID Generator</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Generate RFC 4122 compliant Version 4 UUIDs</li>
      <li>Create multiple UUIDs simultaneously with batch generation</li>
      <li>Copy UUIDs to clipboard with a single click</li>
      <li>Option to remove hyphens for different format requirements</li>
      <li>Convert UUIDs to uppercase or lowercase as needed</li>
      <li>Client-side generation for privacy and security</li>
      <li>No data transmission to servers - works offline</li>
      <li>Mobile-friendly interface for on-the-go ID generation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Use the UUID Generator</h2>
    <p>
      Using our UUID Generator couldn't be simpler. Just visit the page and a new UUID is automatically generated for you. Need
      more? Click the "Generate" button to create a new one, or set the quantity to generate multiple UUIDs at once. You can
      easily copy individual UUIDs or the entire batch with dedicated copy buttons. Optional settings allow you to customize the
      format by removing hyphens or changing the case to suit your specific implementation needs.
    </p>

    <h3>Benefits of Using Our UUID Generator</h3>
    <p>
      Our UUID Generator saves developers and technical professionals valuable time while ensuring the highest quality unique
      identifiers. The tool eliminates the need to implement complex UUID generation algorithms in your code or rely on
      potentially unreliable random number generation. By using our generator, you can be confident that your identifiers will be
      truly unique across systems, preventing data conflicts and ensuring proper database record identification.
    </p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>What is a UUID and why do I need one?</h3>
    <p>
      A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit number represented as 32 hexadecimal digits, displayed in 5 groups
      separated by hyphens. UUIDs are used to uniquely identify information without central coordination, making them perfect for
      distributed systems, database keys, session identifiers, and any scenario where guaranteed uniqueness is required without a
      central authority.
    </p>

    <h3>How unique are the UUIDs generated by this tool?</h3>
    <p>
      The Version 4 UUIDs generated by our tool use cryptographically strong random numbers, providing extremely high uniqueness
      guarantees. The probability of generating two identical UUIDs is so infinitesimally small (about 1 in 5.3×10^36) that for
      all practical purposes, you can consider them guaranteed to be unique, even across billions of generated IDs.
    </p>

    <h3>Is your UUID Generator free to use?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, our UUID Generator is completely free to use with no limitations on the number of UUIDs you can generate. We provide
      this as a free service to developers, database administrators, and anyone else who needs reliable unique identifiers for
      their projects or systems.
    </p>

    <h3>Can I use these UUIDs for my commercial applications?</h3>
    <p>
      Absolutely! The UUIDs generated by our tool are free to use in any application, whether personal or commercial. There are no
      licensing restrictions on using these identifiers in your software, databases, or systems. They conform to the RFC 4122
      standard, making them compatible with all systems that support standard UUIDs.

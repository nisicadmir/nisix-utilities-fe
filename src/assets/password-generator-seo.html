    <h2>Strong Password Generator Tool</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to our Strong Password Generator, a powerful tool designed to create highly secure, random passwords instantly. In
      today's digital world, robust password security is essential for protecting your online accounts from unauthorized access
      and potential data breaches.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Use Our Strong Password Generator?</h2>
    <p>
      Our Strong Password Generator creates complex, unpredictable passwords that are virtually impossible to crack. Unlike
      human-created passwords, which often follow predictable patterns, our generator uses advanced algorithms to create truly
      random combinations of characters. This tool helps you strengthen your online security by providing passwords that meet the
      highest security standards recommended by cybersecurity experts.
    </p>

    <h3>Features of the Strong Password Generator</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Create passwords with customizable length (8-128 characters)</li>
      <li>Include uppercase and lowercase letters for enhanced security</li>
      <li>Add numbers and special characters to increase password strength</li>
      <li>Exclude similar characters to prevent confusion</li>
      <li>Generate multiple secure passwords simultaneously</li>
      <li>Instantly evaluate password strength with visual indicators</li>
      <li>Copy passwords to clipboard with one click</li>
      <li>Client-side generation ensures your passwords never leave your device</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Use the Strong Password Generator</h2>
    <p>
      Using our Strong Password Generator is simple and straightforward. Select your desired password length and choose which
      character types to include (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters). Click the "Generate"
      button, and your secure password will appear instantly. You can then copy it to your clipboard with a single click and use
      it for your accounts. For maximum security, we recommend generating a unique password for each of your online accounts.
    </p>

    <h3>Benefits of Using Our Strong Password Generator</h3>
    <p>
      With our password generator, you can significantly enhance your online security and protect your sensitive information from
      unauthorized access. Strong, unique passwords are your first line of defense against hackers and identity theft. By using
      our tool, you eliminate the risk of creating weak, easily guessable passwords and ensure that your digital presence remains
      secure. Additionally, our password generator saves you time and effort in creating secure passwords manually.
    </p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>How secure are the passwords generated by this tool?</h3>
    <p>
      The passwords created by our Strong Password Generator are highly secure and resistant to brute force attacks and password
      cracking attempts. By including a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, our generator
      creates passwords with high entropy that would take modern computers thousands of years to crack. For maximum security, we
      recommend using passwords that are at least 12 characters long.
    </p>

    <h3>Is the Strong Password Generator free to use?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, our Strong Password Generator is completely free to use without any limitations. We believe that robust password
      security should be accessible to everyone, so we offer this tool as a free service. There are no hidden fees, subscriptions,
      or premium features that require payment.
    </p>

    <h3>Does your password generator store the passwords it creates?</h3>
    <p>
      No, our Strong Password Generator operates entirely on your local device and does not store, record, or transmit any
      generated passwords. The passwords are created in your browser and never sent to our servers, ensuring maximum privacy and
      security. Once you navigate away from the page or close your browser, the generated passwords are permanently erased.
    </p>

    <h3>How can I remember all these complex passwords?</h3>
    <p>
      We recommend using a reputable password manager to securely store all your complex passwords. This way, you only need to
      remember one master password while maintaining unique, strong passwords for all your accounts. Password managers provide an
      excellent balance between security and convenience.

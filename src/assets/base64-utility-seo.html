    <h2>Base64 Utility Tool</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to our Base64 Utility, a comprehensive encoding and decoding tool that handles both text and image data. Base64
      encoding is a fundamental technique in modern computing used for data transmission, embedding resources in web applications,
      and secure data handling. Our utility provides complete Base64 functionality with support for text encoding/decoding and
      image-to-Base64 conversion, making it an essential tool for developers and data professionals.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Use Our Base64 Utility?</h2>
    <p>
      Our Base64 Utility offers comprehensive encoding and decoding capabilities with support for multiple data types. Unlike
      basic Base64 tools that only handle text, our utility provides complete functionality including image conversion, making it
      suitable for web development, API integration, and data processing tasks. The tool's versatility and user-friendly interface
      make complex encoding tasks simple and accessible to both beginners and experienced developers.
    </p>

    </ul>

    <h2>How to Use the Base64 Utility</h2>
    <p>
      Using our Base64 Utility is simple and efficient. For text encoding/decoding, select the appropriate tab, enter your text or
      Base64 string, and click the encode/decode button. For image conversion, select the "Image to Base64" tab, upload your image
      file, and the tool will automatically generate the Base64 data URL. You can preview images before conversion and copy any
      result to your clipboard with a single click. The tool handles all common image formats and provides immediate feedback for
      any errors.
    </p>

    <h3>Supported Data Types and Formats</h3>
    <p>
      Our Base64 Utility supports comprehensive data type handling with proper encoding for different content types. Text encoding
      includes full Unicode support, ensuring that special characters and international text are properly encoded and decoded.
      Image support includes all major web formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP) with automatic format detection and appropriate data URL
      generation. The tool handles file validation, size limits, and error conditions to provide a reliable encoding experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Benefits of Using Our Base64 Utility</h2>
    <p>
      With our Base64 Utility, you can handle all your encoding and decoding needs with a single, comprehensive tool. Base64
      encoding is essential for web development, API communications, data serialization, and secure data transmission. The ability
      to handle both text and image data makes it invaluable for modern web applications. Additionally, the client-side processing
      ensures your sensitive data remains private, with no uploads to external servers or risk of data interception.
    </p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>What is Base64 encoding and why is it used?</h3>
    <p>
      Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that converts binary data into a text format using 64 different ASCII characters.
      It's commonly used for transmitting binary data over text-based protocols like HTTP, embedding images in CSS/HTML, encoding
      email attachments, and storing complex data in text files. Base64 ensures data integrity during transmission and provides a
      safe way to include binary content in text-based systems.
    </p>

    <h3>Is the Base64 Utility free to use?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, our Base64 Utility is completely free to use without any limitations or restrictions. We believe that essential
      encoding and decoding tools should be accessible to everyone, so we offer this comprehensive service at no cost. There are
      no hidden fees, subscriptions, or premium features that require payment.
    </p>

    <h3>What image formats are supported for Base64 conversion?</h3>
    <p>
      Our Base64 Utility supports all major web image formats including JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP. The tool automatically detects
      the image format and generates appropriate Base64 data URLs with the correct MIME type. Images up to 5MB in size are
      supported for optimal performance and browser compatibility.
    </p>

    <h3>Can I encode Unicode text with special characters?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, our Base64 Utility provides full Unicode support for text encoding and decoding. The tool properly handles special
      characters, emojis, international text, and any Unicode content. This ensures that your encoded text can be accurately
      decoded back to its original form, preserving all character information.
    </p>

    <h3>Is my data secure when using the Base64 Utility?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, your data is completely secure when using our Base64 Utility. The tool operates entirely in your browser, meaning your
      text and images never leave your device or get transmitted to our servers. This client-side processing ensures maximum
      privacy and security, especially when encoding sensitive information or confidential images.
    </p>

    <h3>Can I use Base64 encoded images in my web projects?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, Base64 encoded images are commonly used in web development for embedding small images directly in CSS, HTML, or
      JavaScript files. This eliminates separate HTTP requests for small images and can improve page load performance. However,
      Base64 encoding increases file size by approximately 33%, so it's best used for small images and icons rather than large
      photographs.

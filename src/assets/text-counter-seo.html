    <h2>Text Counter Tool</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to our Text Counter, a powerful and versatile tool designed to analyze text content instantly with accurate
      character and word counting. Text analysis is essential for writers, students, content creators, and professionals who need
      to meet specific length requirements or analyze their content. Our counter provides real-time updates as you type, making it
      perfect for any text analysis needs.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Use Our Text Counter?</h2>
    <p>
      Our Text Counter offers a comprehensive solution for text analysis with support for multiple counting methods including
      total character count, character count without spaces, and word count. Unlike basic text counters that only provide one
      metric, our tool gives you all the essential text statistics in one place. The tool operates entirely in your browser,
      ensuring your text remains private and secure without transmitting sensitive content to external servers.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Use the Text Counter</h2>
    <p>
      Using our Text Counter is simple and intuitive. Simply paste or type your text into the text area, and the counter will
      automatically update in real-time. You'll see three different counts: total character count (including spaces), character
      count without spaces, and word count. The tool handles any text content, from short messages to long documents, and provides
      accurate counts instantly. No need to click any buttons or wait for processing - the counts update automatically as you
      type.
    </p>

    <h3>Understanding the Different Counts</h3>
    <p>
      Our Text Counter provides three different metrics to help you understand your text content. Total character count includes
      every character in your text, including spaces, punctuation, and special characters. Character count without spaces excludes
      all whitespace characters, giving you a more accurate measure of your actual content length. Word count uses intelligent
      word boundary detection to count individual words, handling punctuation and spacing correctly to provide accurate word
      counts for any type of text content.
    </p>

    <h2>Benefits of Using Our Text Counter</h2>
    <p>
      With our Text Counter, you can ensure your content meets specific requirements and analyze your text effectively. Whether
      you're writing essays with word count requirements, creating social media posts with character limits, or analyzing content
      for SEO purposes, our tool provides the accurate counts you need. The real-time updates mean you can see exactly how your
      changes affect the counts, helping you make informed decisions about your content. Additionally, the client-side processing
      ensures your sensitive or confidential text never leaves your device, providing maximum privacy and security.
